- Compatible with modern browsers.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the card hover effects in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using the following command:

   ```bash
  (https://github.com/abdul-1432/Js-1_Hover_Effect_)
   ```

2. Copy the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to your project directory.

### Usage

To add a card hover effect to your website, follow these steps:

1. Include the required CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/card-hover-effects.css">
   <script src="path/to/card-hover-effects.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create the HTML structure for the card:

   ```HTML
   <div class="card">
     <div class="card-content">
       <!-- Card content goes here -->
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

3. Add a class corresponding to the desired hover effect to the `card` element. For example, to apply the "fade" effect, add the class `fade`:

   ```HTML
   <div class="card fade">
     <div class="card-content">
       <!-- Card content goes here -->
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

4. Customize the content, styling, and animations of the card as needed.

5. Initialize the card hover effects by calling the `initCardHoverEffects()` function:

   ```javascript
   <script>
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
       initCardHoverEffects();
     });
   </script>
   ```
